				<hr>
					<p>My name is Ivan Ferreira da Silva Lima, I'm 22 years old and I'm graduated in Information System from the Federal University of Pernambuco. I started my professional career at MC2, as an intern, working with the CakePHP framework. After that I started an internship at Ti.Saúde, I was hired after only 5 months for a full-time job, it was at Ti.Saúde that I fell in love with working with software development using Laravel and Vue.js</p>
					<p>I enjoy working in the software engineering field because I can see that my work is positively impacting other people's lives. This is the goal of my life, to improve people's lives and solve problems through technology.</p>
					<p>I studied at a public university, where I didn't pay fees, so I felt I had a duty to use the knowledge acquired at the university to help the community where I live. In 2020 I was part of AraboIA, a project that teaches programming fundamentals to children in the elementary School. In addition, I also took part as a volunteer developer, to develop a website for the university's oil and gas research center.</p>
